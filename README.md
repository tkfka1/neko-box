**Neko-Box** is a simple **GitHub Action** built to make dynamic Gist displaying your latest activity from AniList. 

<br>

## ðŸŽ‰ Usage
**To start, you need to prepare some things:**
- Create a new public GitHub Gist at https://gist.github.com/

- Create an Access Token with the `gist` scope and save it.
You can do that at https://github.com/settings/tokens/new

<br>

**After getting this done:**
- Fork this repository.

- Go to your fork's **Settings > Secrets** page add the following secrets:
	- **`ANILIST_USERNAME`** - Your username from AniList.
	- **`GH_TOKEN`** - The access token you saved earlier.
	- **`GIST_ID`** - The ID of your newly created public Gist.

   *It will look like this:*  
	 `https://gist.github.com/RangerDigital/`**`d1b79f73d3e5a2420ed370b0059dba42`**.

 - Delete a `.github/workflows/schedule.yml` file.

 - Create a `.github/workflows/neko-box.yml` file like this:

 ```yml
 name: Update GitHub Gist with Neko-box!

 on:
   schedule:
     - cron: '*/10 * * * *'

 jobs:
   build:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest

     steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@master

       - name: Update activity from AniList
         uses: rangerdigital/neko-box@master
         with:
           GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
           GIST_ID: ${{ secrets.GIST_ID }}
           ANILIST_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.ANILIST_USERNAME }}
 ```

<br>

**That's It!**  
Now every 10 minutes `neko-box.yml` workflow will update your Gist,  
It's now a good idea to pin it in your profile to show off your weeb power level!
